# Hackerbay_io

## Node.js Backend
### Endpoints
The API features the following endpoint functionalities  

**Public Endpoints**  
1. */login*
    * The api accepts any username/password.
    * Returns a signed [Json Web Token](https://jwt.io/) which can be used to validate future requests.

**Protected Endpoints**  

The following two endpoints should be protected. The JWT obtained in the _/login_ endpoint must be attached to each request.  If the JWT is missing or invalid, these endpoints should reject the request.
1. */home/apply_json_patch*
    * Request body should contain a JSON object and a [JSON patch object](http://jsonpatch.com/).
    * Apply the json patch to the json object, and return the resulting json object.
2. */home/create_thumbnail*
    * Request should contain a public image URL.
    * Download the image, resize to 50x50 pixels, and return the resulting thumbnail.
